Got tacos and margs again with Liam and the girls, but this time it was way too hot so we didn\u2019t stay for long. The two of us collapsed at home and had ourselves a great afternoon, while Lauren and Lizzy and Emma went drinking all afternoon. Then we got a great Chinese dinner and went to a bar. We had such a good time chatting with Liam, and the bar was the perfect vibe. I discovered Allagash, which might be my go-to light beer in the fall."

So we walked the high line with Lauren, looking at apartments for you guys along the way. We got a great Italian dinner in the pouring rain and watched When Harry Met Sally, which was a great way to spend our last night together (for real this time)."

It stemmed from wearing heels that make your feet hurt so badly, but flourished into an all-around type of drunk sadness. You wanted to go home so badly but I convinced you to stay and then walked you home, at which point you decided it would be best to come sleep with me in harps. That was a great call because it allowed us to debrief the next morning. You cried into my shoulder and even though I hope you never feel that sad, I did kind of love it because our hug was so sincere."
